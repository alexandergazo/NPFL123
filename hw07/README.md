### Results

The code in the 7th HW is done and in my opinion should work. The required dialogues, 
however, are not functioning properly. This is, in my opinion, the result of poor NLU
programmed in the assignment 3.

On the other hand, I am satisfied with how is the program performing on `eaxmples.tsv`
from the third homework. The `hw07.yaml` configuration executes this file.

### Implementation

The most important is the `__call__` funciton. Other than that there are functions dedicated
to each intent. The funciton first checks whether all arguments are assigned valid values 
and if yes it then continues with computation.
