I have decided to implement a Telegram bot. Its username is @npfl123_bot.

## Implementation
The server itself is implemented in `dialmonkey/telegram_IO.py` with the backend running in a separate daemon thread.

## Execution
The token is to be placed in `conf/hw09_template.yaml`.
To start the bot, just run dialmonkey with the edited configuration.
