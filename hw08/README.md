Similiar situation as in the 7th homework. What follows is edited version of `hw07/README.md`.

### Results

The code in the 8th HW is done and in my opinion should work. The required dialogues, 
however, are not functioning properly. This is, in my opinion, the result of poor NLU
programmed in the assignment 3.

On the other hand, I am satisfied with how is the program performing on `eaxmples.tsv`
from the third homework. The `twitter.yaml` configuration executes this file.
